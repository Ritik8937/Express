# EXPRESS APPLICATION TASK

We have to clone the repository "https://github.com/notejam/express.git" of Express Application to our director.

Step1:
We create a docker file to dockerised this Express appilcation. by command,

     $ vim Dockerfile

we can use any editor to create dockerfile.
Step2:
Now build this dockerfile to make docker image out of it.

    $ sudo docker build -t <image_name:tag> .

by using this command docker image is build, we can check it through this command,

    $ sudo docker images

Step3:
Now, we have to run our image to create docker container of that image

    $ sudo docker run -it -P <image_name:tag>

we can see the port number by using command,
        
    $ sudo docker ps

Now, we can check our Express Application are and running or not, 
for this open browser and give address http://localhost:port-number
 

Then we have to deploy this application on Kubernetes cluster. After setting up the Kubernetes cluster with kubeadm, create a deployment for this Express Applicatiom on master node.

Step1:
  
    $ sudo kubectl create -f <deployemnt_name.yaml>

Step 2:
Now check the deployments by this command,

    $ sudo kubectl get deployments

and status of pods with this command,

    $ sudo kubectl get pods

Our deployment is successfully done ,

Step3:
Now we should expose this pod to outside world for accessing the Application
we use service as a NodePort.

    $ sudo kubectl expose deployment <deployment_name> --type=NodePort

Now, our deployment are exposed for accessing this check the svc to know the ports and ips.

    $ sudo kubectl get svc

Then, run our app on port given in NodePort.
and we can it thorugh the port number which is shown when we run service command.
